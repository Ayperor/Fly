# Fly

This project was completed using VS2008 targeting the .NET v3.5 framework (fairly recently and on purpose).  It will run on everything from a tricked out version of Windows 2000 up through Windows 11.

It's a VB.NET version of what was called Mosca (Italian for fly) in... I think 2000 or so.  The original Mosca was written by Stefano Occhetti.  It's actually a really annoying fly that follows the mouse around the screen.  

My version of it uses the original Mosca graphic and is written as kind of a proof of concept screen animation example.  I have a second piece of JavaScript with an almost as pointless purpose that I'm half thinking of writing in VB.NET or C#.  

I may be alone in this, but ActiveDesktop was really nice years ago.  Unfortunately, too many people made the mistake of running random code on their desktop so it was dubbed 'insecure' and was replaced by widgets that were just as insecure, then eliminated completely.  Recently they came out with something else... Don't know, don't care... I'll write my own or I won't.

The fly is on Ichigo's cape near the top.  There are no dependencies other than .NET.
