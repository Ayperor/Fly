Although the heavy work on this was done in 2017, today I removed the need for the external
gif files and compiled a release of the fly.  The fly pictures are in the resFly resource 
file now and fly.exe can run on any machine with the .net 3.5 framework installed.

Runs on ishtar (special windows 2000)
